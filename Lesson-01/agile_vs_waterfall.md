## Differences Between Agile vs. Waterfall:

Both methodologies can help developers produce high-quality project management. 
Depending on the specific project requirement, knowing the difference between agile and waterfall can better equip 
a development team to choose the right process and methods in delivering a successful software project. 
Some distinct differences are:

* Agile is an incremental and iterative approach; Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach.
* Agile separates a project into sprints; Waterfall divides a project into phases.
* Agile helps complete many small projects; Waterfall helps complete one single project.
* Agile introduces a product mindset with a focus on customer satisfaction; Waterfall focuses on successful 
project delivery.
* Requirements are prepared everyday in Agile, while requirements are prepared once at the start in Waterfall.
* Agile allows requirement changes at any time; Waterfall avoids scope changes once the project starts.
* Testing is performed concurrently with development in Agile; testing phase comes only after the build phase in 
a Waterfall project.
* Test teams in Agile can take part in requirements change; test teams in Waterfall do not get involved in requirements
change
* Agile enables the project team to operate without a dedicated project manager; Waterfall requires a project manager
who plays an essential role in every phase.

###<span style="color:Green">**What Is Agile Development?**</span>
[Agile development](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/agile-software-development/) is a team-based approach that emphasizes rapid deployment of a functional application with a focus 
on customer satisfaction. It defines a time-boxed phase called a sprint with a defined duration of two weeks.

At the start of each sprint, a list of deliverables are prioritized based on customer input. At the end of the sprint, 
the developers and the customer review and evaluate the work with notes for future sprints. As a methodology based on 
general principles, more specific methods based on processes such as Scrum and Kanban are called types of agile 
methodology.

###<span style="color:Green">**What Are the Benefits of Agile?**</span>

Some of the known benefits of an agile project are:

* Faster software development life cycle
* Predictable schedule in sprints
* Customer-focused approach, resulting in increased customer satisfaction
* Flexible in accepting changes
* Empower teams to manage projects
* Promotes efficient communications
* Ideal for projects with non-fixed funding

###<span style="color:Green">**What Are the Disadvantages of Agile?**</span>

The following are disadvantages of agile:

* Agile requires a high degree of customer involvement, which not all customers are comfortable with or prefer to give.
* Agile assumes every project team member is completely dedicated, without which weakens the principle of self-management.
* A time-boxed approach may not be enough to accommodate all deliverables, which will require changes in priority and 
additional sprints that can bring up cost.
* Agile recommends co-location for efficient communication, which is not always possible.

###<span style="color:Yellow">**What Is the Waterfall Development Process?**</span>

Waterfall project management is a sequential approach that divides the SDLC to distinct phases such as requirements 
gathering, analysis and design, coding and unit testing, system and user acceptance testing, and deployment. 
The next phase can only proceed if the previous phase has been completed. In between phases, a deliverable is 
expected or a document is signed off.

All phases are passed through and completed only once, so all requirements are gathered as much as possible at the 
start to provide the information in creating the plans, schedules, budget, and resources. It is plan-driven, so any 
changes after the project has started would offset the original plan and require a restart.

###<span style="color:Yellow">**What Are the Benefits of Waterfall?**</span>

The following are the benefits of waterfall methodology:

* Straightforward planning and designing due to the agreement on deliverables at the start of the project.
* Better design with whole-system approach
* Defined scope of work
* Easier costing
* Clear measurements of progress
* Defined team roles
* Dedicated resources can work in parallel for their specific tasks

###<span style="color:Yellow">**What Are the Disadvantages of Waterfall?**</span>

Newer development methodologies were created because of known disadvantages of waterfall, including:

* Rigid structure to allow necessary changes
* No allowance for uncertainty
* Limited customer engagement, resulting in poor satisfaction
* Sequential approach is not ideal for a large-sized project where the end result is too far in the future
* Testing is done only at the latter phases of the project.

A better way to approach a software development project is to focus first on your business goals. Then teams can choose,
adapt, and even customize to create the best hybrid methods fit for their needs.
